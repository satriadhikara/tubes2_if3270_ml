# LSTM Model Parameter Fix

## Issue Fixed

This fix addresses the "unbuilt parameters" issue where the LSTM model parameters were showing as 0 in the model summary. This happens because Keras models are not fully "built" until data passes through them.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed lstm_keras_training.ipynb:
- Added a sample forward pass before displaying the model summary
- This ensures all parameters are properly initialized and counted by the `model.summary()` function

### 2. Fixed lstm_from_scratch_testing.ipynb:
- Added a forward pass on a sample batch in the Keras model before summary display
- Added a comprehensive parameter breakdown for the from-scratch model
- Added parameter counting by layer type (Embedding, LSTM, Dense)

### 3. Enhanced from_scratch/model.py:
- Added a comprehensive `count_parameters()` method
- Added a new `summary()` method that displays the model architecture similar to Keras
- Added detailed parameter counting for each layer type
- Fixed the initialization to show parameter count when the model is created

### 4. Fixed from_scratch/layers.py:
- Renamed attributes in Bidirectional layer for consistency and proper parameter counting
- Added comments for better code organization and understanding

## How to Verify the Fix

1. Run the `lstm_keras_training.ipynb` notebook
   - The model summary should now show properly built parameters (not zeros)
   - Training should proceed normally

2. Run the `lstm_from_scratch_testing.ipynb` notebook
   - The Keras model should show correct parameter counts
   - The from-scratch model will now display a detailed summary of its architecture
   - Parameters counting will match between both implementations

## Technical Details

The issue occurs because Keras models have a two-stage initialization:

1. When a model is created, the layer objects are instantiated, but their weights aren't initialized until the input shape is known.
2. The first time data passes through the model, the layer shapes are inferred and weights are created.

Our fix adds a forward pass with a dummy input tensor before displaying the model summary, ensuring all weights are properly initialized and counted.
